I coded all of the functional code in this project from watching the provided tutorial videos! They were very helpful and helped me pretty easily complete everything up until the custom drawing.

For my drawing I sketched it out first on my ipad using the built in grid reference on procreate, that way all the corners lined up with a conventional grid and were easy to transfer over. I then hand coded all the vertices to create the mushroom drawing!

I have no experience with website coding so I used Chatgpt as a reference for adding the CSS style elements, and to help come up with the algorithm for creating the custom color palette (to create the soft gradient using math).

I also added an alpha slider, a color preview, and a toggle button for the mushroom reference photo!
